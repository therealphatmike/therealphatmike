- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @therealphatmike. I'm a software engineer at Toyota Racing Development where I work on global motorsports applications. Apps I've contributed to are used in NASCAR, IMSA, and other regional, national, and international series.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in development, cooking, cars, and a few other random things.
- :notebook: I currently am focused on building tools to help developers and teams get the most out of cloud infrastructure and supercharge their ability to deliver value to their organization.
