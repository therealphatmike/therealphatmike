- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @therealphatmike. I'm a software engineer at Toyota Racing Development where I work on global motorsports applications. Apps I've contributed to are used in NASCAR, IMSA, and other series.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in development, cooking, cars, and mountain biking.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning kubernetes and cybersecurity as well as sharpening up my old PHP skills and getting a better handle on Laravel.
- :notebook: I currently am focused on  full stack Javascript development and a little bit of C++. I generally deploy it all via AWS.
